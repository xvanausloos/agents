      "#### Concept:\n",
      "Build a platform that leverages big data and advanced analytics to help businesses track, measure, and optimize their sustainability and environmental impact. The platform collects data from various sources—IoT devices, public environmental data, supply chain data, and internal business operations—to provide actionable insights for reducing carbon footprint, waste, and energy consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Features:\n",
      "- **Real-time Data Integration:** Connect with IoT sensors (energy meters, waste monitors), company ERP/CRM systems, and public data sources (weather, environmental indices).\n",
      "- **Custom Sustainability Dashboards:** Visualize KPIs such as carbon emissions, water usage, and waste generation tailored to industry and company size.\n",
      "- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast environmental impact based on planned activities (e.g., production changes, new suppliers).\n",
      "- **Compliance & Reporting Support:** Automatically generate reports aligned with global standards (e.g., GRI, CDP) and upcoming regulations.\n",
      "- **Benchmarking & Recommendations:** Compare performance against industry peers and receive AI-driven recommendations for improvement.\n",
      "- **Supplier & Supply Chain Analytics:** Assess sustainability risks across suppliers and optimize procurement decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Market Opportunity:\n",
      "- Increasing regulatory pressure on corporations to disclose sustainability metrics.\n",
      "- Growing consumer demand for environmentally responsible companies.\n",
      "- Multinational corporations aiming for ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) compliance.\n",
      "- SMEs looking for affordable solutions to manage sustainability without large in-house teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Monetization Model:\n",
      "- SaaS subscription tiers based on company size and feature sets.\n",
      "- Premium consulting services for data-driven sustainability strategy.\n",
      "- Data partnerships with NGOs or governmental bodies.\n",
